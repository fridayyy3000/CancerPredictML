Cancer Classification Project
Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on the classification of cancer cases as either malignant or benign. The project utilizes a dataset comprising relevant features extracted from cancer samples, with the aim of building a predictive model to assist in cancer diagnosis.

Key Features
Dataset: The project uses a comprehensive dataset of cancer samples, including various clinical and biological features.

Machine Learning Model: A machine learning model has been developed to predict the nature of the cancer based on the provided features.

Data Preprocessing: Extensive data preprocessing techniques have been applied, including handling missing values, feature scaling, and exploratory data analysis.
